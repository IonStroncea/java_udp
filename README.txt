This is a simple chat made using UDP protocol. Application is made in Java.

The program starts like any Java program. Either directly in the development environment,
or from the console, using the command "javac *" and then "java Main.Main"

To send a message in the console, enter the address where we want to send the message and then the message itself.
They are delimited by space.
To end the conversation with someone, write "*address* exit"
To close the application, write the command "exit"
